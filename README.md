# MahJong Score Calculator with Computer Vision 


## Plan

Designing a MahJong Score calcualtor because some players are having trouble calculating the winning score for winner.  

- Training ML model to identify each face from the mahjong set
- Then compile all faces from the winner's hand and turn into the values to compute the final score



## Todos 
- [x] Setting up the dataset  
- [x] Demo the show the image
- [x] Planning using image classification or image segmentation ( - [x] Image Segmentation)
- [ ] ~~Fix the issue with CNN # of parameters~~
- [ ] Learning about using coreML with PyTorch 
- [ ] Learning how to deploy small model on mobile devices ex: PyTorch Mobile, TensorFlow Lite, CoreML 
- [ ] ~~Try using ResNet, MobileNet~~
- [ ] ~~Identify the hand card can utilizing the strategies of splitting the card face and get a sub picture of it~~
- [ ] Collect MahJong hand dataset from internet 
- [ ] Label the dataset 
- [ ] Fine-tuning the dataset on different YOLO version/ SSD / Faster-CNN
