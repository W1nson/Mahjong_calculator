# MahJong Score Calculator with Computer Vision 


## Plan

Designing a MahJong Score calcualtor because some players are having trouble calculating the winning score for winner.  

- Training ML model to identify each face from the mahjong set
- Then compile all faces from the winner's hand and turn into the values to compute the final score
